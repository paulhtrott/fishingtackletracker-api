# FishingTackleTracker Api
Api for serving data to FaishingTackleTracker apps.

This api will only be used locally to consume the api to learn EmberJs with a Rails Api backend.
Why ember? Why not?

Ok, it is an api I will use it to learn front-end JS frameworks as needed, for example, Ember, React, etc...
